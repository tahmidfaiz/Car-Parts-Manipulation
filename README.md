# Car-Parts-Manipulation
This program reads the lines from an external .txt file that lists all the car parts and manipulates the data and updates the .txt file. 

# How The Program works
The program first reads a .txt file and provides info about how many lines were read. Next, the program states the options menu which is listed from 1-4 and has different functions. option 9 is to exit the program. 
Option 1 allows the user to see all the car parts in the txt file and their index.  

Option 2 allows the user to search for car parts by inputting the part name. The program then states if the part is found and at what specific index. If the part is not found, then the program states "NOT found". 

Option 3 allows the user to add a car part by inputting the name of the car part which is then added in alphabetical order and the index is increased. 

Option 4 allows the user to delete a car part by inputting the index of the car part they would like to delete. The program then states the item at the specific index was removed. If  the index does not exist then the program states "invalid index a ..."  

Option 9 exits the program.
